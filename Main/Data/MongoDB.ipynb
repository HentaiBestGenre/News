It also has not one Spider-Man, but seven of them (two of which are Peter Parker, though he's a supporting character at best). It doesn't pull inspiration from a classic Spider-Man story, but rather one of the most complex and goofy ones, in which Spider-Man works with all of the other Spider-People from other Marvel Earths. It's a weird movie. It's a really, really good, weird movie, though.
